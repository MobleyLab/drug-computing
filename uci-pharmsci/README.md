# Content relating to UCI's PharmSci 175/275, Drug Discovery Computing Techniques

## What's here
This will provide course materials for UCI's PharmSci 175 and 275 courses, which are currently taught in parallel, with 175 being the undergraduate version.
This will ultimately contain syllabus information, lecture notes and slides, required reading, sandboxes and examples used in class, and assignments.

## Manifest
- [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md): provides information on basic software requirements for the class and where to get started. Two major options are provided - using this content through Google Colab, or installing locally.
- [`Getting_Started.ipynb`](Getting_started.ipynb): Jupyter notebook **for use on Google Colab** which can install most of the required software there. The below notebook, using `condacolab`, is probably superior.
- [`Getting_Started_condacolab.ipynb`](Getting_Started_condacolab.ipynb): Jupyter notebook **for use on Google Colab** which can install most of the required software there; works FASTER than `Getting_Started.ipynb` and is PROBABLY superior.
- [`continuing.md`](continuing.md): Helpful tips for continuing on AFTER having followed getting started information
- [`syllabus.md`](syllabus.md): Syllabus for PharmSci 175/275
- [`assigned_materials.md`](assigned_materials.md): Assigned reading/instructional materials for the course, for use with the detailed schedule as posted on Canvas.
- [`docs`](docs): Directory containing documentation/background reading relating to the course, which are usually linked to from elsewhere in this material.
- [`lectures`](lectures): Course lectures and interactive in-class examples/sandboxes
- [`assignments`](assignments): Assignments for the course.

## Getting Started
- **[Setup and Installation](getting-started.md)**
- **[How to use Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)**

## Requirements

Please begin by reading the beginning portion of [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) and deciding whether you are going to install the software locally or use in Google Colab. Depending on which of those you choose there will be different requirements for getting going, as detailed there.


#### Cheatsheets and dotfiles
Under the **uci-pharmasci/docs/** directory, we have included some useful command cheat sheets for [BASH](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/docs/bash_cheatsheet.jpg) and [vi](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/docs/vi_cheatsheet.pdf) (on OS X, zsh is becoming default instead, but in general it is similar.).

You may also want to check out the [CodeAcademy Github](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) tutorial.

We have also included several _dotfiles_ (configuration files with filenames beginning with the `.` character) for VMD and Vim to set some common default settings.

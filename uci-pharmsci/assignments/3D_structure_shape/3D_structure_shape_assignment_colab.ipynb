        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment involves two major parts. It first introduces the OEChem toolkits by having you perform some simple tasks with molecules in two and three dimensions, including generating 3D structures of molecules (much of which you will have already seen in the 3D structure/shape lecture and Jupyter notebook). You will also convert between common file formats and do simple shape overlays as well as visualization of your molecules. Some software installation will be required.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the second major part of this assignment, you will use shape overlays to try and recognize HIV integrase inhibitors from a small library of potential HIV integrase inhibitors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## More detailed overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment works through common tasks for working with small molecules. Specifically, you want to model a molecule, and you need to build 2D and 3D structures of the molecule, save to a particular file format for visualization, and compare it to other molecules. Here, you get to do these for the first time. Many different tool sets do these tasks, but here I’ll introduce you to one particular tool set (from OpenEye software) that works particularly well with Python and is free to academics. You have already seen and used this set of tools in class in the 3D structure/shape Jupyter notebook. This assignment will simply build on that notebook. Especially, Step 0 through Step 3 replicate tasks done in that notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing these initial tasks, you will then take a small library of potential HIV integrase inhibitors, and use a shape-based search to try and identify active compounds on the basis of shape similarity to known inhibitors."

        "The first step is to build some molecules to work with. You might need to do this because your boss or research adviser asks you to model certain molecules, or you might come across some 2D structures of molecules in a research paper you would like to model. In any case, for whatever reason, you have a list of molecules to model, and you need to start by building their structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s start by building 2D structures. If you already have commercial or favorite software for this, like ChemDraw, feel free to use that. If not, I recommend Marvin, which is free, as noted in the 3D structure/shape lecture. You can use it [within your browser](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/); you may need to install a free Java plugin to do so) or [download it](https://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/marvinsketch/) and install it on your computer (http://www.chemaxon.com/download/marvin/for-end-users/). I normally use the desktop version. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Marvin, draw some structures of molecules (if you have some molecules you’re interested in because of another class or research, you should do them, otherwise just pick some) and save them to your computer (from the file->save as menu) as MDL SDF files, one at a time. \n",
        "\n",
        "Drawing them should produce something like this:\n",

        "Use the buttons at the bottom to create pre-formed rings; the tools at right can be used to select specific bond types or stereochemistry, and the buttons at right can be used to introduce elements other than carbon.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should select at least 5-10 molecules to build, of your choice. Try to include some which are relatively similar to one another (i.e. differing only by a functional group, for example) and some which are not.\n",
        "\tOnce your molecules are built, I suggest loading them (or at least one) in PyMol (open PyMol, then go to File->Open, then select your file) and having a quick look. You should see something like the below, though obviously details will depend on your platform (OS X, Linux, Windows) and what you’ve named your molecules. I suggest clicking the “show” button (S, as indicated by the red arrow) and choosing the “sticks” representation so you can see your molecule more clearly. Try clicking it and dragging to rotate -- notice how the molecule is completely planar (two dimensional) right now, even though it shouldn’t be. If you would like, you can choose Display -> Show Valences to show bond types. Experiment with using S to show other representations (such as surface) if you like, and use H to hide representations you’re done with.\n",

The code here is a little complicated (which is why I’ve written similar code for you) and the only things you should have to change are the variable names and the indentation. What this ultimately will do is take two molecules, overlay them in a number of different ways, and then return (give back to the user) the actual overlays of the molecules, sorted from best to worst, and the “Tanimoto” scores of the overlays in the same order. Tanimoto scores are scores running from 0 to 1 and essentially measure similarity, where 0 means totally dissimilar and 1 means totally identical. Here, we are actually combining TWO Tanimoto scores (a ‘shape’ Tanimoto score and a ‘color’ (Chemistry) tanimoto score) so our overall Tanimoto score runs from 0 to 2.\n",

        "Your next step involves a simple application of this shape overlay technique to a real problem. You will take an existing ligand -- an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor -- from a structure the protein data bank (PDB) and compare this to a set of molecules which were tested experimentally for possible HIV integrase inhibition. The idea is to see whether the molecules which actually are HIV integrase inhibitors are among those which are most shape similar to the known inhibitor. \n",

The 3NF8 structure in the PDB gives the crystal structure of one integrase inhibitor from this series bound to HIV-1 integrase. We will use the ligand from that structure as a query, or reference molecule, to see if it easily allows us to recognize other molecules which are likely to bind from our larger set of 600-700 compounds. This somewhat echoes the SAMPL4 HIV integrase challenge reported in [this paper]( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-014-9723-5), though the set of inactive compounds has been expanded somewhat by addition of a portion of the Maybridge fragment library which was also tested experimentally.\n",

        "- For every molecule, generate a 3D conformation with your `expandConformations` function, using `strictStereo` set to False (a few molecules have unspecified stereochemistry, and setting this to false here will cause OEChem to pick a random stereoisomer in such cases, which is acceptable in this test)\n",
        "- Use your `fitMolToReference` function to overlay your molecule/conformations onto the reference molecule. Do this twice (getting back two different sets of output) — once with ShapeColor = False and once with it True, so we can compare and find out which works better here.\n",

        "- Sort your molecule names by score (for each of the two sets of scores you have). I give an example of how to sort below.\n",
        "- Compare your list of molecule names sorted by score with the list of actual binders (see code below) and identify where you find the actual binders. What you want to track at this stage is how many binders you find at or before each *rank* (entry number) in the list of sorted scores. For example, if there are 60 binders distributed across 650 molecules, you might find the first binder at the top of the list, the second binder at entry number 5, and the third binder at entry number 10. For every entry in the sorted list, store the number of binders found — so in this example, your first 10 entries would be `[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]`. If this is still confusing, [see here](ranks.md) for a little more about this process.\n",
        "- For each list of number of compounds found by rank (do this twice, once for each of your two sets of scores), convert it to a list of fraction of actual binders found by rank, by dividing each entry by the total number of binders in the set. For example, if you have found one binder and there are 60 in total, the fracion actives found is 1/60.\n",
        "- Plot the fraction of binders found at each rank, versus the rank, for each of your two scoring schemes. This is an \"enrichment plot\".\n",
        "- Also plot what would be expected if you picked compounds to call \"active\" at random. (Hint, in this approach you would expect to find no actives at rank 0, and all of the actives at rank N, with the fraction of actives found increasing linearly in between). This will allow you to determine whether your approach is doing better than random at recognizing likely active compounds."

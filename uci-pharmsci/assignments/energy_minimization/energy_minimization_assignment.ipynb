    "# Energy Minimization Assignment, PharmSci 175/275\n",
    "##### By David Mobley (UCI), Jan. 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adapted with permission from an assignment by M. Scott Shell (UCSB)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will begin with a provided template and several functions, as well as a Fortran library, and add additional code to perform a conjugate-gradient minimization. That is, you will write a conjugate-gradient minimizer. You will then apply this minimize to generate Lennard-Jones clusters with varying numbers of particles, and look at how the energy varies as a function of cluster size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook for this assignment is laid out with action items YOU need to take labeled as Step 1-7. These are interspersed with background information on the problem, some examples, and a sandbox section to tinker with some of the functions. So read on, and watch for the sections which require your action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Lennard-Jones clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters are small, stable packings of (often spherical) particles. These particles could be colloidal particles, nanoparticles, etc. There has been considerable work spent studying these clusters over the years, from atomic sizes up to colloidal particles in the nanometer to micrometers scale. Cluster analysis is important to understanding a range of phenomena, including structures of solids, aggregation and precipitation of particles, the structure of nanomaterials, self-assembly behavior of synthetic and biomolecular systems, and diffusion in dense liquids.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cluster can be characterized by the number and type of particles and the energetic interactions between them. Here, we will examine Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters, which are clusters of simple attractive spherical particles with interactions modeled by the Lennard-Jones interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For LJ clusters, there are cluster sizes of unusual stability. These are called magic number clusters and correspond to cluster sizes where the packing of atoms is particularly efficient, leading to very favorable energies and hence exceptional stability. The most stable such clusters are built from an icosahedral arrangement of particles, and the first few such **magic numbers** for cluster sizes of icosahedral geometries are 13, 19, 38, 55, and 75. \n",
    "\n",
    "These clusters are still interesting from a basic physical chemistry point of view, but our interest here is mainly in (a) energy minimization algorithms, and (b) learning how to do non-trivial numerics in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here, we will energy minimize Lennard-Jones clusters of different sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will examine different numbers of particles and attempt to find the minimum energy cluster for each number of particles. Our energy model will use the LJ potential in its dimensionless form (meaning that we have changed units so that all of the constants are hidden in the units). We denote this by putting a star on the potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U^* = \\sum \\limits_{i<j} 4(r_{ij}^{-12} - r_{ij}^{-6})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a random initial configuration of particles, and try to use an energy minimization algorithm to find the most stable configuration of particles. But when there are more than just a few particles, there will be more than one local minimum, so there is no guarantee the energy minimizer will find the global minimum. In such cases, we will need to minimize from random initial configurations many times in order to ensure we locate the global minimum.\n",
    "There is also the possibility of forming multiple separate clusters separated by a significant difference. This is not unlikely, since the LJ interaction is only very weakly attractive at large distances. So, to ensure we form single clusters, we will use a weak biasing potential to pull all of the particles towards the origin, biasing the system towards forming a single cluster. Otherwise, the LJ potential will tend to be too weak to pull together very distant particles in these tests. We will use a harmonic biasing potential, so that the total potential energy (“force field”) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U^* = \\sum\\limits_i \\alpha |\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 + \\sum \\limits_{i<j} 4(r_{ij}^{-12} - r_{ij}^{-6})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use $\\alpha = 0.0001 N^{-2/3}$ where $N$ is the number of particles; this will be a very small number. This particular form is selected so that the energy due to this term for a cluster of $N$ particles is, on average, constant regardless of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional details\n",
    "For this assignment, your job is to perform a conjugate-gradient minimization of Lennard-Jones particles which are initially randomly distributed in space. I am providing several items for you:\n",
    "* A Fortran library (emlib) which you can use within Python to calculate energies and forces\n",
    "* A Python library (pos_to_pdb.py) which you can use to output structures to your disk to visualize motion of your particles (for example with PyMol) if you so desire\n",
    "* A template for your assignment (below) in iPython notebook format; this also will be posted on the class website in plain Python format in case my experiment with iPython notebooks fails here. \n",
    " * This template contains some code which will get you started, including code for a line search minimization. \n",
    " * It also contains places for you to write the functions (outlined below) you need to write to complete the assignment.\n",
    "* Here we will be using position and force arrays to represent positions/forces on all of the atoms in the system. Make sure you are [comfortable with that notation](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/lectures/energy_minimization/energy_minimization.ipynb) before beginning.\n",
    " \n",
    "## A quick (but important) note on Notebook usage:\n",
    "iPython notebooks such as this one often contain a variety of cells containing code. These are normally intended to be run, which you can when you have an individual cell selected, by hitting the button at the top with a 'play' symbol, or by typing shift-enter. If you do NOT do so on each of the cells defining variables/functions which will be used here, then you will encounter an error about undefined variables when you run the later cells. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Your step 1 for the assignment: Start by doing some file bookkeeping:\n",
    " * Find `emlib.f90` and optional utility `pos_to_pdb.py` in this directory.\n",
    " * In the command prompt navigate to that folder and type 'f2py3 -c -m emlib emlib.f90' which should compile the fortran library for use within python (For more on F2Py, refer to the [f2py documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py)). In OS X, this may require you to install the (free) XCode developer tools (available from the Mac App store) and the command-line developer tools first (the latter via `xcode-select --install`). In Linux it should just work. Windows would be a hurdle.\n",
    " * In your command prompt, start theis Jupyter notebook (in OSX this would be something like 'Jupyter notebook energy_minimization_assignment'), which should open it in your web browser; you're running it already unless you are looking at the HTML version of this file.\n",
    " \n",
    "Template Python code for the assignment is provided below. I suggest making a new notebook which is a copy of this one (perhaps containing your name in the filename) and working from there. \n"

    "## Installing Packages\n",

    "`!f2py3 -c -m emlib emlib.f90`\n",
    "to compile your Fortran library and then it will be importable below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous years, we would advise that if you were running this on Google Colab, you should add the installation blocks from the [getting started notebook](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/Getting_Started.ipynb) or [condacolab](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/Getting_Started_condacolab.ipynb) here and then execute the code below. However, this year, doing any installs in Colab seems to cause problems with the Fortran compiler, so you should use f2py before installing anything (and you probably don't need to install anything for this assignment). \n",

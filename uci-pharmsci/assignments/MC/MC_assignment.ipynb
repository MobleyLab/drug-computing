        "\n",
        "Authors: David L. Mobley (UC Irvine) and M. Scott Shell (UCSB); adapted by Mobley from a similar assignment by Shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective and intro:\n",
        "In this assigment you will perform a basic Monte Carlo simulation for the same linear polymer system as in the Molecular Dynamics assignment (which is a prerequisite for this assignment), and compute thermodynamic properties for this system. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview:\n",
        "Here, we will study the same simple model of polymers as in the MD assignment, where we have a series of Lennard-Jones spheres connected by harmonic spring “bonds”. Here, you will use Fortran routines that are provided for energy evaluations, and write your own Python Monte Carlo code for proposing and accepting or rejecting moves (as you will have seen in the Monte Carlo sandbox we tried in class). The Fortran code is provided, and you will write your own Python code. A template containing some functions (reused from the MD assignment) you may want is provided below. \n",
        "While this LJ system is, again, not of direct relevance to drug discovery, the Monte Carlo approach sees widespread use in a huge range of settings including molecular simulations but also in a wide range of other areas. It is very much worth being familiar with the basic approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "### Some settings\n",
        "For the general background of what you’re simulating and the variables ($M$, $L$, $Cut$, etc...) see the [Molecular dynamics assignment](../MD/MD.ipynb). Again, the simulation will use periodic boundary conditions, a cutoff of $R_c = 2.5$, and no tail correction. Again, $N = 240$, $T = 1.0$, and $N/V = 0.8$ (dictating $L$). As usual in these assignments, we are using dimensionless variables. Since the system to be simulated is the same, this writeup will focus on details.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part A: Write a Python code for MC simulation of the polymeric system\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task here is to write a Python code to perform MC simulations of the polymeric system. A Fortran library for evaluating energies of the system, given a position array, is provided (as in the last assignment). A template for your Python code is given below, along with documentation for the provided functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will work in the canonical ensemble (NVT) here, and your MC moves should consist of single-atom displacements by random amounts in each of the x, y, and z directions. Each step, you will propose a move of some (randomly selected) atom by up to some maximum displacement in each of the x, y, and z directions. \n",
        "\n",
        "To make this process faster, do not evaluate the entire potential energy every time an atom is moved. Moving a single atom only changes interactions involving that atom, so you can compute only the interaction energy of that atom with other atoms. A Fortran function is provided that will do this in `mclib.f90` (which you will need to compile as usual via `f2py -c -m mclib mclib.f90`). This means that it is unnecessary to do a full energy evaluation for every proposed MC move. But note that, to get the energy change $\\Delta U$, you need to calculate this interaction energy both before and after a proposed move. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can then keep a running total of the energy by doing updates of the form $U = U+\\Delta U$. As noted in class, _only make this change after a move is accepted_. Also, for precision reasons, you will need to recompute the total energy occasionally (do this every 10 moves per particle (a move per particle just means you've done enough moves you could have moved each particle once, but since you pick particles randomly you won't necessarily do so), or 2,400 moves) by doing a full update of the system energy (with the provided Fortran function). \n",
        "\n",
        "During your MC simulation, you should compute the average acceptance ratio by keeping track of the number of proposed and the number of accepted moves. The acceptance ratio is the number accepted divided by the number proposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will probably want to write a function `ProposeMove`: which takes a position array and a maximum step size; picks a random particle in the position array and displaces it by a distance up to the maximum step size in each direction, and returns the new proposed position array. You are free to write other functions also if they are helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "One practical consideration: Explicit copies of arrays are required to save positions before moving a particle. For example, you might do the following:"

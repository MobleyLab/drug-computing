        "\n",
        "Solubility estimation/prediction is a huge problem in drug discovery. Here, we will attempt to build a simple empirical model for solubility prediction as in a recent literature challenge. We will take a set of ~100 solubility values, and develop a simple model which reproduces those values reasonably well, then test this model on a new set of compounds (a test set). To put it another way, we have a test set and a training set, and want to use the known solubilities from the training set to predict solubilities for the test set. \n",
        "\n",
        "This builds on the solubility challenge of [Llinàs et al.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci800058v) and the conclusions/subsequent work of [Hopfinger et al.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci800436c).\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Solubility calculation is an important problem for drug discovery, partly because it is so important that drugs be soluble. Solubility is an important factor in the design of orally bioavailable drugs, as we have discussed in class. However, no good physical models are available for work in this area yet, so most of the models for solubility estimation are empirical, based on measuring a set of simple molecular properties for molecules and combining these to estimate a solubility in some way, based on calibration to experimental data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently, Llinàs et al., [(J. Chem. Inf. Model 48:1289 (2008))](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci800058v) posed a challenge: Can you predict a set of 32 solubilities on a test set, using a database (training set) of 100 reliable solubility measurements? Follow up work [(Hopfinger et al., J. Chem. Inf. Model 49:1 (2009))](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci800436c) provided the solubility measurements of the test set and assessed performance of a wide variety of solubility estimation techniques in this challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, your job is to construct several simple linear models to predict solubilities using the training set of roughly 100 compounds, and then test their performance on the test set, comparing them with one another, with a null model, and with the performance of research groups which participated in the challenge. You should also implement and test a simple variant of the LINGO-based approach of Vidal et al. (J. Chem. Inf. Model 45(2):386-393 (2005)). \n",
        "\n",
        "A good deal of the technology you will need to use here is provided for you, including example models. Your job in this assignment is simply going to be to adjust the Python code I have provided to build several (five or more) new models for predicting solubilities, plus one based on the approach of Vidal, and compare their performance to select your favorite. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Some setup notes\n",
        "\n",
        "In this directory, you should also find a module you can import which will help with some statistics -- `tools.py`. You will also find two directories containing structures of molecules in the different sets -- `llinas_predict`, containing molecules whose solubilities we want to predict, and `llinas_set`, containing molecules in the training set. Additionally, in the `scripts` directory there is `solubilities.pickle` which contains solubility data (not human readable).  \n",
        "\n",
        "I also provide some fairly extensive example code below which you can use as the basis for your assignment. To briefly summmarize the provided code (you can see more detail by reading the comments and code below) it loads the structures of the molecules and their names, computes a reasonably extensive set of descriptros or properties of the different molecules and loads in the actual solubility data. It then proceeds to build two extremely simple models for predicting solubilities based on a simple linear combination/fit of physical properties. You will be able to use this part of the program as a template for building your own solubility models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## For solubility prediction, we'll use a series of *descriptors*\n",
        "\n",
        "Descriptors are properties of our molecule which might (or might not) be related to the solubility. For example, we might think that solubility will in general tend to go down as molecular weight goes up, and go up as polarity increases (or go down as polarity decreases) and so on. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here, let's take a sample molecule and calculate a series of descriptors which we might want to use in constructing a simple solubility model. "

        "$y = mx + b$\n",
        "\n",

For example, (as a null model) I might assume that solubility can be predicted simply based on molecular weight -- perhaps heavier compounds will in general be less (or more) soluble. I might write:\n",

This will allow you to quickly test how well you can predict solubilities based on pure molecular similarity to compounds in your training set. Obviously your training set is limited in size, but it’s still a worthwhile test.\n",

Perhaps there may generally be a trend that larger compounds are somewhat less soluble -- not for chemical reasons, but rather for reasons of pharmaceutical interest (many drugs tend to be somewhat large and somewhat less soluble), so some of the descriptors correlated with molecular weight (such as number of atoms, number of heavy atoms, etc.) may be better predictors of solubility than you might guess. On the other hand, hydration free energy is closely related to solubility (it’s the solution part of a solubility), and some of the other descriptors may be as well.\n",

In fact, this dataset tends to have a relatively large number of compounds which are not very soluble, and a small number which are extremely soluble. What this means is that if we aren’t careful, the few extremely soluble compounds will end up playing a huge role in the development of our models. Thus, here, it actually makes more sense to work with the logarithm of the solubility, which we’ll call logS.

        "You'd make similar changes to the computation of `predictvals` to parallel those made calculating `fittedvals`. You can leave all of the statistics code below that unchanged, and just modify the print statements to indicate what model it is you are testing. \n",

        "### Performance metrics for your models\n",
        "\n",
        "As noted in class, one should always have metrics for judging the performance of a model. Here, my code (in `tools.py`, imported below) provides several. The Kendall tau value is a measure of ability to rank-order pairs of compounds, and runs from -1 (every pair ranked in the opposite order) to 1 (every pair ranked perfectly) with a value of 0 corresponding to every pair being ranked incorrectly. The RMS error measures a type of average error across the entire set of compounds relative to experiment; units here are logS, and lower values mean lower error on average. The $R^2$ (here called `R2` or `Rsquared`) value is the correlation coefficient, and like the Kendall tau has to do with predictive power (in this case, how well the calculated values correlate with the experimental ones), though it has some limitations (such as sensitivity to extremes of the data). It runs from -1 to 1, with -1 meaning perfect anticorrelation, 1 meaning perfect correlation, and 0 meaning no correlation. Also, for the purposes of comparison with the Hopfinger paper, I have provided code to calculate the percentage of predictions within 0.5 log units, which will allow you to compare with the different methods listed there in terms of both RMS error and percentage correct. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to these metrics, the code also automatically compares to the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the calculated and measured logS values, and provides the probability (based on the Kendall tau test) that you could get this Kendall tau accidentally when in fact there was no correlation. When this probability is extremely small, it means that your model almost certainly has at least some predictive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, what you should see is that as you make your models better, the Kendall tau and $R^2$ values should go up towards 1, and the RMS error should go down. You should also see the probability of getting the Kendall tau value by change go down towards zero. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Reminder concerning good versus bad models\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that, as discussed in class, adding parameters to a model should always make it fit the data better. That is to say, if you compare to models, one using one descriptor, and another using two descriptors, in general the model with two descriptors should have a higher Kendall tau on the training set and a lower RMS error than the model with one descriptor. This doesn’t mean the model with two descriptors is better, necessarily -- it just means it has more parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, as we noted in class, a good model is, in general, the simplest possible model that fits the data well enough. And a model with fewer parameters is generally preferable over one with more. Also, a good model should perform relatively similarly on the training set (the known compounds) versus the test set (those we are predicting). So, as you construct your models, you may want to keep this in mind. It also might be worth deliberately trying to construct a model which is overfitted, perhaps by including a whole lot of descriptors, until you reach the point where your performance is significantly worse in the test set than the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Statistical significance tests\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, we should also be calculating uncertainties for our different metrics, and applying statistical significance tests to test whether each new model is significantly different than the old model. For example, the t-test could be used to attempt to reject the null hypothesis that a new model is no better on average than the old model. Also, having error bars (calculated via bootstrapping, for example) on the RMS error, $R^2$, etc., could also help us know when two models are not significantly different. However, because this assignment must be done fairly quickly, these tests are not included as part of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What to do and what to turn in\n",
        "\n",
        "You need to build and test at least five different models. You should try at least one model that uses four or more descriptors, hopefully getting to the point where you see significantly worse performance on the test set than on the training set. Keep track of every set of descriptors you try. \n",
        "\n",
        "When you complete the assignment, turn in a brief report (entering it below following the code is fine) containing your discussion and any relevant statistics, etc. This should include:\n",
        "- Your Python code \n",
        "- The sets of descriptors you tried\n",
        "- The statistics describing performance of the model you believe is best, and a brief description of why you chose that model as best\n",
        "- A brief discussion comparing your best model with performance of the contestants in Hopfinger et al., as per the logS section of table 2 on the 28 compound test. Specifically, you should be able to compare your Rsquared and percentage within 0.5 log units with the values given in that table. Is your simple model beating many of the contestants? Why do you think that is? How much worse is it than the best models? \n",
        "- (If you did the LINGO section -- mandatory for graduate students) Comment on how well the LINGO similarity approach worked relative to other approaches you tried, and why you think it succeeded or failed.\n",

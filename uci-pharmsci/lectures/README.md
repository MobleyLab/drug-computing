# PharmSci 175/275 Lecture Materials

This provides in-class materials for lectures and interactive sessions for PharmSci 175/275.

## Lectures and Jupyter notebooks

Lectures and course materials use the Jupyter notebook format which allows easy mixing of code, text, images, and other materials, so you will need to have Jupyter notebooks working to make usef of the materials provided here.


## Organization

This is organized into sub-directories based on the teaching topic, with the topics presented in the typical numerical order below but file organization done by name.
Since the material will typically draw from external files, you are recommended to either obtain the entire repository or at least a copy of the relevant day's directory.

## Instructional content

1. Python, Linux, and vi(m): [Python_Linux_Vi](Python_linux_Vi): Lecture is Jupyter notebook (with RISE format slides)
2. Energy minimization: [energy_minimization](energy_minimization): Lecture is Jupyter notebook (with RISE format slides)
3. 3D structure and shape methods: [3D_structure_shape](3D_structure_shape): Lecture is Jupyter notebook (with RISE format slides)
4. Quantum mechanics (QM): [QM](QM): Lecture is Powerpoint format, with a [supplemental Jupyter notebook](QM/psi4_example.ipynb) with example Psi4 usage.
5. Molecular dynamics (MD): [MD](MD): Lecture is Keynote/PDF format
   - Supplementary material: [MD/MD Sandbox.ipynb](MD/MMD Sandbox.ipynb) Jupyter notebook
6. MD (part 2) and Monte Carlo (MC): [MC](MC): Lecture is Keynote/PDF format
   - Supplementary material: [MC_sandbox](MC_sandbox)
7. Solvation models: [solvation](solvation): Lecture is a Jupyter notebook (with RISE format slides)
8. Docking, scoring, and pose prediction: [docking_scoring_pose](docking_scoring_pose): Lecture is a Jupyter notebook, `docking.ipynb`, plus a PDF of old slides (which need some updating and provide the latter part of the content because conversion to Jupyter notebook format is not yet complete). An asssociated `OEDocking.ipynb` provides a docking example.
9. Library searching: [library_searching](library_searching): Includes Keynote/PDF of lecture slides, and a sandbox on library and lingo searching (Jupyter notebook format).
10. Ligand based design: [ligand_based_design](ligand_based_design): Includes a keynote/PDF of slides and a supplementary `ligand_based_design.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with supplemental materials.
11. Physical property estimation: [empirical_physical_properties](empirical_physical_properties): Includes a Keynote/PDF of slides, as well as a minimal Jupyter notebook that sets the stage for the solubility prediction assignment. More extensive examples are provided in the solubility prediction assignment.
12. Fluctuations, correlations and error analysis part 1: [fluctuations_correlations_error](fluctuations_correlations_error): Predominantly a lecture class; Keynote slides and a PDF are available.
13. Error analysis, part 2: [fluctuations_correlations_error](fluctuations_correlations_error): Jupyter notebook format including activities and slides; alternate HTML format is also available. 
14. Molecular visualization
15. Proteins
16. OpenMM, MDTraj, clustering and visualization: [cluster_and_visualize](cluster_and_visualize)
17. (a) Normal modes and related models
17. (b) Mixture simulations: [mixtures](mixtures)
18. Free energy calculations and the drug discovery process

Usually we also have one guest lecture/tour by Nathan Crawford, who discusses high performance computing and takes us on a tour of the server room.

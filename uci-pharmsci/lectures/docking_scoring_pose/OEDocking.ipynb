    "# Docking molecules into a pre-defined binding site\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous tutorials, you should have learned how to generate the full 3D structures starting from a given SMILES string. Now, we will take those 3D molecules and dock them into a pre-prepared receptor file that has the protein binding site already defined. To prepare a receptor file for docking, see the [MAKE_RECEPTOR](https://docs.eyesopen.com/oedocking/make_receptor_gui.html) docs for the OpenEye Toolkits. This particular example uses a prepared receptor of soluble epoxide hydrolase that we have been working on for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be using the docking method [FRED](https://docs.eyesopen.com/oedocking/fred.html) which is used in cases where the protein does not have a bound ligand, but we define a region or box to dock our molecules to."

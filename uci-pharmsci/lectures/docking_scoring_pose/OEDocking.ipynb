    "In previous tutorials, you should have learned how to generate the full 3D structures starting from a given SMILES string. Now, we will take those 3D molecules and dock them into a pre-prepared receptor file that has the protein binding site already defined. To prepare a receptor file for docking, see the [MAKE_RECEPTOR](https://docs.eyesopen.com/applications/oedocking/make_receptor/make_receptor_gui_layout.html) docs for the OpenEye Toolkits, or you can also do this via the command line. This particular example uses a prepared receptor of soluble epoxide hydrolase that we have been working on for research purposes.\n",

## Other useful materials:
- For very helpful material on Linux and Python relevant to our area, refer to [Oliver Beckstein's Computational Methods in Physics course](https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/overview/), which has sectionns on Linux/Unix, Python, git, etc.
- For additional background information on Linux, check out [Code Academy's course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).
- MIT has a nice course, [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) which covers the shell, shell tools/scripting, editors, data, command-line, version control, debugging and profiling, security and cryptography, and a variety of other topics.
- [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ssh++-Fc+-N+-f+hs) provides a place where you can type in Linux shell commands and it will explain them to you
